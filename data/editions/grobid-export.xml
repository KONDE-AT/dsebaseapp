                <p>We present a code-switching corpus of Turkish-German that is collected by recording conversations of bilinguals. The recordings are then transcribed in two layers following speech and orthography conventions, and annotated with sentence boundaries and intersentential, intrasen-tential, and intra-word switch points. The total amount of data is 5 hours of speech which corresponds to 3614 sentences. The corpus aims at serving as a resource for speech or text analysis, as well as a collection for linguistic inquiries.</p>

                <p>Code-switching (CS) is mixing two (or more) languages in spoken and written communication

                </p>
                <p>In parallel, the interest in processing mixed lan- guage is on the rise in the Computational Lin- guistics community. Researchers work on core tasks such as normalisation, language identifi- cation, language modelling, part-of-speech tag- ging as well as downstream ones such as auto- matic speech recognition and sentiment analysis 
                    <ref type="bibr">(Çetino˘ glu et al., 2016)</ref>. The majority of the cor- pora used in these tasks come from social media

                <p>Social media has the advantage of containing vast amount of data and easy access. Depending on the medium, however, limitations might arise.</p>
                <p>For instance, Twitter, the most popular source so far, allows the distribution of tweet IDs rather than tweets themselves, which can be deleted. Hence it is hard to use the full resource, reproduce previous results or compare to them. Moreover the charac- ter limit and idiosyncratic language of social me- dia bring extra challenges of processing in addi- tion to challenges coming from code-switching.</p>
                <p>Spoken data has also been a popular source in computational CS research 
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Solorio and Liu, 2008;</ref>

                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Yilmaz et al., 2016)</ref>. There are no limitations on the length of sentences, idiosyncrasies are less pro- nounced. Despite such advantages, it is almost solely used in speech analysis. To our knowledge, only
                    <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Solorio and Liu (2008)</ref> have used transcrip- tions of CS speech in text analysis. One reason that researchers processing CS text prefer social media could be that it is already text-based, and it requires much less time and effort than speech col- lection transcription. For the existing speech cor- pora, discrepancies between the speech transcrip- tions and the input text processing tools expect could be a drawback. For instance the SEAME corpus (
                    <ref type="bibr">Lyu et al., 2015</ref>) does not use punctuation, capitalisation, or sentence boundaries in transcrip- tions, yet standard text processing tools (POS tag- gers, morphological analysers, parsers) are trained on edited text, hence make use of orthographic cues.
                </p>
                <p>In this paper, we introduce a Turkish-German code-switching corpus of conversations and their two layers of transcriptions following speech and orthography conventions. The data is annotated with sentence boundaries and intersentential, in- trasentential, and intra-word switch points. Our aim is to provide a resource that could be used by researchers from different backgrounds, e.g., for speech recognition and language identification in speech, for language identification and predicting CS points in text, and as a corpus of empirical ev- idence for linguistically interesting structures.</p>

                <p>Creating code-switching corpora for speech anal- ysis has started with reading designed text rather than spontaneous speech. 
                    <ref type="bibr">Lyu and Lyu (2008)</ref> use a Mandarin-Taiwanese test set for their language identification system that consist of 4.8 hours of speech corresponding to 4600 utterances. The set is designed to have Mandarin as the main language with one or two Taiwanese words re- placed with their Mandarin counterparts. Solorio and Liu (2008) recorded a conversa- tion of 40 minutes among Spanish-English bilin- guals. The transcribed speech contains 922 sen- tences with 239 switch points among them. The authors used this data to train machine learning al- gorithms that predict CS points of an incremen- tally given input.
                </p>
                <p>Speech collections have always been the pri- mary source in sociolinguistic and pyscholinguis- tic research. We list some of these spoken corpora that employ code-switching instances of Turk- ish and German, mixed with other languages or with each other. The "Emigranto" corpus 
                    <ref type="bibr">(Eppler, 2003</ref>) documents conversations with Jewish refugees settled in London in 1930s, who mix Austrian German with British English. In this cor- pus, Eppler (2011) looks into mixed dependencies where a dependent and its head are from different languages. She observes that dependents with a mixed head have on average longer dependencies than ones with a monolingual head.
                </p>
                <p>In a similar fashion, Tracy and Lattey (2009) present more than 50 hours of recordings of el- derly German immigrants in the U.S. The data is fully transcribed and annotated, yet each ses- sion of recordings is transcribed as a single file with no alignment between transcript utterences and their corresponding audio parts, and annota- tions use Microsoft Word markings, e.g. bold, italic, underline, or different font sizes, thus re- quire format conversions to be processed by auto- matic tools that accept text-based inputs.

                    <ref type="bibr">Rehbein et al. (2009)</ref> and Herkenrath (2012) study the language acqui- sition of Turkish-German bilingual children. On the same data Özdil (2010) analyses reasons of code-switching decisions. The Kiezdeutsch cor- pus (
                    <ref type="bibr">Rehbein et al., 2014</ref>) consists of conversa- tions among native German adolescents with a multiethnic background, including Turkish. As a result, it also contains a small number of Turkish- German mixed sentences.

                <p>The data collection is done by the annotators as conversation recordings. We asked the annota- tors to approach Turkish-German bilinguals from their circle for an informal setting, assuming this might increase the frequency of code-switching. Similarly we recommended the annotators to open topics that might induce code-switching, such as work and studies (typically German-speaking environments) if a dialogue started in Turkish, or Turkish food and holidays in Turkey (hence Turkish-specific words) in a German-dominated conversation.</p>
                <p>28 participants (20 female, 8 male) took part in the recordings. The majority of the speakers are university students. Their ages range from 9 to 39, with an average of 24 and a mode of 26. We also asked the participants to assign a score from 1 to 10 for their proficiency in Turkish and German. 18 of the participants think their German is better, 5 of them think their Turkish is better, and the re- maining 5 assigned an equal score. The average score for German is 8.2, and for Turkish 7.5. 
                    <ref type="bibr">2</ref> is decided according to the pronunciation. If the proper name is pronounced in German, and fol- lowed by a Turkish suffix a § switch point is in- serted. Otherwise it follows Turkish orthography.

                <p>The annotation and transcriptions are done using Praat. 
                    <ref type="bibr">3</ref> We created six tiers for each audio file: spk1_verbal, spk1_norm, spk2_verbal, spk2_norm, lang, codesw. The first four tiers contain the verbal and normalised transcription of speakers 1 and 2. The tier lang corresponds to the language of intervals and can have TR for Turkish, DE for German, and LANG3 for utter- ances in other languages. The first five tiers are intervals, while the last one is a point tier that denotes sentence and code-switching boundaries. The labels on the boundaries are SB when both sides of the boundary are in the same language, SCS when the language changes from one sen- tence to the next (intersentential), WCS when the switch is between words within a sentence (in- trasentential).
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref> shows a Praat screenshot that demonstrates the tiers and exemplifies SCS and WCS boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>Since Turkish is agglutinative and case mark- ers determine the function of NPs, non-Turkish common and proper nouns with Turkish suffixes are commonly observed in CS conversations. We mark such words in the codesw tier as a intra- word switch and use the symbol § following Çetino˘ glu (2016). Example (1) depicts the rep- resentation of a mixed word where the German compound Studentenwohnheim 'student accom- modation' is followed by the Turkish locative case marker -da (in bold).</p>
                <p>For speech analysis it is important to transcribe utterances close to how they are pronounced. In some transcription guidelines, capitalisation and punctuation are omitted (e.g. in the SEAME cor- pus ( 
                    <ref type="bibr">Lyu et al., 2015)</ref>
                    <ref type="bibr">4</ref> ), in some others they are used to mark speech information (e.g. in the Kiezdeutsch corpus (
                    <ref type="bibr">Rehbein et al., 2014) 5</ref> ). Text analysis on the other hand generally relies on stan- dard orthography. This raises a conflict between two tasks on how to transcribe speech. To avoid this problem, we introduced two tiers of transcrip- tion. The verbal tier follows the speech conven- tions. If a speaker uses a contraction, the word is transcribed as contracted. The acronyms are writ- ten as separate characters. Numbers are spelled out. Recurring characters are represented with the single character followed by a colon. The nor- malised tier follows the edited text conventions. Words obey the orthographic rules of standard Turkish and German, e.g. characters of acronyms are merged back. Punctuation is added to the text, obeying the tokenisation standards (i.e. separated from the preceding and following tokens with a space).
                </p>
                <p>Example 
                    <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> gives a sentence showing the ver- bal and normalised tiers for a Turkish sentence. The r sound in the progressive tense suffix -yor is not pronounced, hence omitted in the verbal tier. The vowel of the interjection ya is extended dur- ing speech, and the colon representation is used to reflect it in the verbal tier, yet the normalised tier has the standard form. Also, the question mark is present in the normalised tier. 'in the student accommodation' For many proper names, Turkish and German orthography are identical. Here, the speech data in parallel becomes an advantage, and the language If a made-up word is uttered, it is preceded with an asterisk mark in the transcription. Note that dialectal pronunciation or using a valid word in wrong context is not considered within this class. Partial words are marked with two hyphens instead of the common use of one hyphen, as the latter is used in German to denote the initial part of a com- pound when two compounds share a common part and the first compound is written only as the un- shared part (e.g. Wohn-und Schlafzimmer 'living room and bedroom').
                </p>
                <p>We also marked 
                    <ref type="bibr">[silence]</ref>,
                    <ref type="bibr">[laugh]</ref>,

                    <ref type="bibr">[other]</ref> category. Overlaps occur usually when one speaker is talk- ing and the other is uttering backchannel signals and words of acknowledgement. There are also cases both speakers tend to speak at the same time. In all such cases, both voices are transcribed, one speaker is chosen to be the main speaker, and an
                    <ref type="bibr">[overlap]</ref> marker is inserted to the sec- ondary speaker's verbal and normalised tiers. The codesw and lang tiers are decided according to the main speaker's transcription. empty, if the lang and codesw tiers have values from their label sets, and if the lang and codesw labels are meaningful, for instance, if there are TR labels on both sides of a SCS (intersentential CS) boundary, either the boundary should be corrected to SB or one of the language labels should be DE or LANG3. Any mistakes are corrected by the an- notators on a second pass.
                </p>
                <p>For the quality control of the transcriptions we employed Turkish and German morphologi- cal analysers 
                    <ref type="bibr">(Oflazer, 1994;</ref>
                    <ref type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2004</ref>) and analysed all the tokens in the normalised tier according to their languages. We then created a list of tokens unknown to the analysers, which are potentially mispelled words. The annotators went through the list and corrected their mistakes in both the verbal and normalised tiers. The re- maining list also gives us the words unknown to the morphological analysers.

We present a corpus collected from Turkish- German bilingual speakers, and annotated with sentence and code-switching boundaries in audio files and their corresponding transcriptions which are carried out as both verbal and normalised tiers. In total, it is 5 hours of speech and 3614 sentences. Transcriptions are available for academic research purposes.

They also correspond to the 55.3% of all switches. 38% of them happen between words, and the remaining 6.7% are within a word.

One category we have seen more prominent in speech data is non-standard syntactic constructions, per- haps due to spontaneity. For instance, Example

                <figDesc>Chan et al. (2009) introduce a Cantonese-English cor- pus of read speech of 3167 manually designed sentences. English is inserted into Cantonese as segments of one or more words. Another read speech corpus is created by Shen et al. (2011) for Mandarin-English and consists of 6650 utterances. Li et al. (2012) collected 5 hours of code-switched Mandarin-English speech from conversational and project meetings. Intersentential and intrasenten- tial switches add up to 1068 in total. Lyu et al. (2015) present the largest CS speech resource, the SEAME corpus, which has 192 hours of transcribed Mandarin-English interviews and conversations in the latest version. 1 The code- switching points naturally occur in the text, as both languages are written in their own scripts. A recent corpus of 18.5 hours is introduced by Yilmaz et al. (2016) on Frisian-Dutch broadcasts. CS points are marked in the transcriptions but not on the audio level.</figDesc>
